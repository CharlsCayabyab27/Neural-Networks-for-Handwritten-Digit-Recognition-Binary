# Neural Networks for Handwritten Digit Recognition (Binary)

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing a neural network for the recognition of handwritten digits using a binary classification approach. The goal is to train a model that can accurately classify input images of handwritten digits as either 0 or 1.

## Dataset

The model will be trained and evaluated on a dataset of handwritten digits. The dataset includes a set of images labeled with their corresponding digit (0 or 1). This dataset will be split into training and testing sets to assess the model's performance.

## Architecture

The neural network architecture will consist of layers designed to extract features from the input images and make predictions. The model will use a binary classification output layer with appropriate activation functions and loss functions for the task.

## Implementation

The project will be implemented using a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The code will include data preprocessing, model creation, training, and evaluation steps. Hyperparameter tuning may be performed to optimize the model's performance.

## Evaluation

The performance of the trained model will be evaluated on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Visualization techniques may also be employed to analyze the model's predictions.

## Dependencies

Make sure to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
